# Playful Drum: Interactive Tangible Interaction 
( Project For Bauhaus Universitat ) 


Welcome to the Playful Drum project repository! ü•Å

# Introduction
This Project presents the tangible interaction through Playful Drum that communicates with other devices in a bidirectional way. It receives and sends messages in its unique way, enhancing musical expression through dynamic real-time communication.

# Features
Tangible Interaction: Engage with the Playful Drum physically for a unique musical experience.
Bidirectional Communication: The drum communicates with other devices, receiving and sending messages.
Dynamic Real-time Communication: Novel application of real-time communication for musical expression.

# Challenges and Solutions
Code Implementation: Adding AI in form of Decision tree for Pattern recognition in high Accuracy to the arduino.
Development Process: Explains the iterative development process.
Upgrade: Describes the evolution from basic hit detection to defining different music tempos and patterns.
Usage
Connect the Playful Drum to your desired device.
Hit the drum to trigger different actions based on the number of hits and device number.
Explore various musical tempos and patterns by adjusting your hitting speed.
Moreover reciving massage and hitting back on the drum based on the Device number.

Contribution
Contributions to enhancing the Playful Drum project are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests with your improvements.
